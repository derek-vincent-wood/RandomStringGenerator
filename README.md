# RandomStringGenerator
A small script in C++ I made for generating a variable number of strings, each of a specified number of random ASCII characters, ostensibly for password generation, albeit given that the source of randomness is time, it may not be desirable. It loads all of the strings into a file whose name is specified by the user.
